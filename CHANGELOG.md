## [1.1.1] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- `firmware/src/odometry.cpp` — position integration used updated heading θ+dθ instead of midpoint θ+dθ/2, causing systematic drift in curves
- `ros2/launch/gazebo.launch.py` — raw-read of `.xacro` passed unexpanded XML to `robot_description`; replaced with `xacro.process_file()`
- `docs/faq.md` — max speed still said 0.61 m/s (stale); corrected to 0.39 m/s; broken link to nonexistent `lidar_compatibility.md` replaced with upstream kaiaai/LDS URL
- `docs/roadmap.md` — v1.0 date was 2025 (typo); v1.1 completed items now checked off
- `ros2/rviz/navigation.rviz` — `Nav2Panel` was listed under Displays (wrong section); moved to Panels; added `/odometry/filtered`, TF, and Particle Cloud displays

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed (Critical)
- `firmware/src/safety.cpp` — e-stop latched permanently after startup; now cmd_vel timeout auto-clears when commands resume; battery/overcurrent still latch
- `firmware/src/safety.cpp` — ignore battery voltage 0V at boot (ADC not ready) to avoid false low-battery e-stop
- `firmware/src/microros_bridge.cpp` — `_lastCmdMs` initialized to 0 triggered immediate cmd_vel timeout; now set to `millis()` in `begin()`
- `firmware/src/pid.cpp` — skipped integral accumulation when Ki=0 (was silently accumulating unbounded integral that never affected output)
- `docs/wiring.md` — voltage divider resistors 100kΩ/220kΩ would put 8.6V on GPIO36 (above 3.3V ADC limit); corrected to 100kΩ/33kΩ
- `firmware/src/main.ino` — `MAX_VEL_MS = 0.61f` exceeded JGA25-370 physical maximum; corrected to 0.39 m/s
- `ros2/config/cartographer_lds_2d.lua` — IMU was disabled (`use_imu_data=false`); enabled with correct `tracking_frame = "imu_link"`
- `ros2/launch/slam.launch.py` — missing `robot_state_publisher` caused broken TF tree in standalone SLAM mode

### Added
- `firmware/src/main.ino` — OTA firmware update support (`setupOTA` + `ArduinoOTA.handle`)
- `firmware/src/ota_update.h` — progress %, error callback, hostname (`loki-esp32`)
- `firmware/test/test_encoder.cpp` — 6 host-side unit tests for tick-to-velocity math
- `.github/workflows/ros2_build.yml` — ROS2 colcon build + launch file validation CI
- `host/map_saver.py` — CLI flags (`--dir`, `--prefix`, `--interval`), auto-save loop, timeout

### Changed
- `firmware/src/safety.h` — added `_latchedFault` field to track latching vs auto-clearing faults
- `firmware/src/wifi_config.h` — added setup instructions and `AGENT_RECONNECT_MS`
- `ros2/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro` — added inertia macros (cylinder/sphere), caster wheel, wheel dynamics, LiDAR visual
- `ros2/config/ekf.yaml` — 50 Hz frequency, full process noise covariance matrix, `odom0_differential: false`
- `ros2/config/navigation.yaml` — DWB tuned for JGA25-370 physics (max_vel_x 0.22 m/s, acc 1.5 m/s², inflation 0.18 m)
- `ros2/launch/teleop.launch.py` — removed xterm dependency (not installed by default on RPi)
- `ros2/launch/slam.launch.py` — added robot_state_publisher for correct TF
- `ros2/package.xml` — added missing exec_depends (robot_localization, nav2_map_server, etc.)
- `ros2/CMakeLists.txt` — install sdf directory; use QUIET for optional packages
- `docs/wiring.md` — full GPIO table with notes, I2C device table with addresses, corrected voltage divider
- `docs/calibration.md` — fixed Ki reference (0.1→0.8 to match firmware), added ROS2 verification commands
- `docs/ros2_setup.md` — complete rewrite with correct symlink-based workspace setup and topic verification
- `scripts/setup_rpi.sh` — fixed systemd service (ExecStartPre source → wrapper script), build loki_robot package
- `README.md` / `README_EN.md` — added CI badge for PlatformIO Build + ROS2 Build
